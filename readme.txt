A trash for categories, tags and custom terms. Deleted a category by mistake? Restore it with its posts, child terms and menu links.

== Description ==

Posts and pages go to the trash when you delete them. Categories and tags don't: one click on "Delete" and the term is gone. WordPress also moves its posts to "Uncategorized", moves its child categories up a level and removes it from your menus. Getting it back means restoring a database backup.

Category & Tag Trash keeps every deleted term for 30 days (or 7, 90 or 365, your choice).

**Undo** appears the moment you delete a term, on the Categories, Tags or any other term screen, for single and bulk deletes. **Restore** later from Tools > Category & Tag Trash puts back:

* the term itself, with the **same ID**, name, slug, description and parent,
* all of its term meta (colours, images, SEO fields stored by other plugins),
* every post it was assigned to, in the same order,
* its child terms, moved back underneath it,
* the menu links that pointed to it, in the same menu and position, with their sub-items,
* and it removes "Uncategorized" from posts that only got it because of the deletion.

Keeping the same ID matters: navigation blocks, widgets and shortcodes that point to the term by ID work again without editing them.

Works with categories, tags, WooCommerce product categories and attributes, and any custom taxonomy that has an admin screen.

Free and open source under the GPL. No pro version, no upsells, no ads in wp-admin, no tracking. And it stays that way.

= Where to find it =

* **Tools > Category & Tag Trash** lists deleted terms with what they were attached to, who deleted them and when. Filter by taxonomy, search, restore or delete in bulk, see exactly which posts, child terms and menus a restore brings back, and empty the trash.
* Every category and tag screen has a link to it under the list.

= WP-CLI =

* `wp category-tag-trash list`
* `wp category-tag-trash restore <id>...`
* `wp category-tag-trash delete <id>...` or `wp category-tag-trash delete --all`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens if a new term uses the old slug? =

The restored term gets a unique slug instead, and Category & Tag Trash tells you which one.

= What if a post was deleted while the term was in the trash? =

It is skipped. Everything else is restored.

= What if I changed a post's categories in the meantime? =

Only posts that still have exactly the default category plus the restored term lose the default category. Posts you changed by hand are left alone, and so are child terms you moved somewhere else.

= How long are terms kept? =

30 days by default, then a daily task deletes them for good. Choose 7, 30, 90 or 365 days on the Category & Tag Trash screen, or use the `category_tag_trash_retention_days` filter.

= Can I leave a taxonomy out? =

Use the `category_tag_trash_supports_taxonomy` filter. Menus are never kept, because deleting a menu removes its items first.

= Does it work for a tag on thousands of posts? =

Yes. The posts are saved in small chunks, so the trash stays light. A restore brings back the first 5,000 posts right away and the rest in the background, and `wp category-tag-trash restore <id>` does it all in one go. Search plugins like ElasticPress are told about every post that gets its term back.
